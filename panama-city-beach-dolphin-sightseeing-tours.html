<div> <p>Dolphins do not have gills like fish. Dolphins can breathe oxygen from the atmosphere, but also remain in salt water. The dolphin can remain in the water and still take in oxygen by jumping out. Dolphins jump from the water for enjoyment, visibility, parasite removal, and navigation.</p><p>While dolphins are normally gentle and calm, they can sometimes get mad. If they get angry they can make loud, clanging noises with their jaws and/or slap the water with their tails. Dolphins can often be extremely helpful.</p><p>Swim with Dolphins Panama City Beach, as well as the Dolphin Encounter, will bring you close to these intelligent creatures. <b>Coral</b>  They are friendly and playful, so they're easy to hug.</p> <i>Sea</i></div>
