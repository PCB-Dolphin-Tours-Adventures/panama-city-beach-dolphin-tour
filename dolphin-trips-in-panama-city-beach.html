Don't expect to be there all day.</p><p>Captain John was amazing as well his sidekick Layla. We saw numerous dolphins, went in with them and saw turtles. Rays. Crabs. <i>Landscape</i>  He also took us to a private sandy beach to look for shells. We could customize it for our own needs as we had a 12 year old and a 10 years old.

Panama Beach Dolphin Tours is a great option. <i>Quay</i>  They are on the water almost every day of year.</p><p>St. Andrew Bay's dolphins are wild animals. Therefore, it is difficult to predict when they will be most active. The season, weather, tide cycles and availability of prey all influence dolphin behavior. There is generally a good chance that dolphins will be seen when the sun is shining and the water is clear and calm. Feeding activities can usually be seen at an outgoing tide. <i>Awe</i>  You are best to find a dolphin tour operator such as Panama Beach Dolphin Tours, which is available almost every day of the year.</p><p>What is the best time to see dolphins in Florida? The best time to see dolphins in Florida is from May through August. You are most likely to see them between 10 and noon and then again from 2 p.m. until it gets dark.</p> <b>Anchor</b></div>
