<div><p>About twenty minutes. <b>Landscape</b>  The ride to the island takes about twenty minutes. There are great opportunities to spot manatees, turtles, and dolphins along the way. On the ferry boat, we often see seabirds on our journey to Shell Key.</p><p>Although dolphins are generally gentle, they can get angry at times. They can be loud and agitated by their jaws, or their tails, making it hard to get the water. Dolphins can be very helpful.</p><p>PANAMA CITY BAY -- The sighting of whales off Panama City Beach is a rare one. However, they do occasionally make an appearance on the shore, especially during winter months. There are many species of whales that inhabit the Gulf of Mexico.</p></div>

<div> <p>Dolphinaria may want you to believe otherwise, but they are powerful ocean predators capable of killing sharks. People, dolphins, and even self-harm can all be frightened by dolphins. <b>Anchor</b>  Although most dolphins in the U.S. are kept in captivity, the majority are wild animals.</p><p>SeaWorld's Jacobs noted: "Animal remains are always disposed of according to state law and zoological best practices. Many skeletons are donated for scientific research or museums to ensure that the animal's knowledge and education can continue after their death.</p><p>4. Wear only a bathing suit. You should only wear a swimsuit. Dolphins are very sensitive and will touch you during your interaction.</p> <i>Quay</i></div>
